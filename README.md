CFP is a community project to provide Arma 3 with 100 new or enhanced real world factions/sub-factions involved in current and historical armed conflicts. CFP comes in two flavours - CFP and CFP Ultimate, only CFP requires **Community Upgrade Project (CUP)**. 

CFP offers not only enhanced vanilla CUP factions but also a huge number of new factions using CUP and community donated assets. CFP includes custom assets and textures in order to help expand whats possible with CUP. For more information on <a href="https://github.com/tupolov/cfp/blob/master/README.md">CFP see HERE</a>.

**CFP Ultimate** enhances base CFP factions (if running CFP) and introduces new factions using the most efficient combination of community gear, weapon and vehicle addons. CFP Ultimate requires VSM, SMA and NIArms.  

Factions are delivered in a modular way, enabling groups to maintain their own tailored version of CFP/CFPU by simply excluding any components they don't need, or those possibly in conflict with other mods. 

## CFP Ultimate Features
- 30 new factions/sub factions!
- CFP Ultimate enhances CFP factions by replacing certain CUP assets with assets from other mods, adds new unit classes/uniforms and adds Special Forces elements to existing factions.
- Includes compatibility addons for groups using 3CB, BWmod and US Military Mod
- Randomization tech that provides variation of gear and equipment to appropriate units and vehicles resulting in hundreds of possible civilian, insurgent, PMC, clandestine operative and special forces units and vehicles.
- Standardizes faction and group configurations for the community
- Follows best practice configuration and implementation using CBA and ACE3 standards
- Full support for ZEUS, ALiVE, ACE3 and VCOM

Where available we have used the correct assets for each faction. Where an asset is unavailable we have used a placeholder. Here are the following assets we are looking to be donated to the project:

Equipment | Weapons | Ground Vehicles | Aircraft | Naval
